# Cryptography_src
A collection of cryptography functions written in C++

This is a collection of cryptography functions I made as solutions for challenges on edabit.com.

the challenges, with explanations of the functions can be found at the following links(from least complex to most complex)
 1 - Atbash Cipher, https://edabit.com/challenge/977xgdi57bp23ibz5
 2 - Caesesar's Cipher, https://edabit.com/challenge/GmPfqu2jmLDBD2NYS
 3 - Bacon Cipher, https://edabit.com/challenge/fvBsB9oQchCSquxec
 4 - PlayFair Cipher, https://edabit.com/challenge/XdhAcbSJ3wsbiFHC7
 
The Atbash cipher and Caesar's cipher are very simple, the Bacon Cipher and PlayFair Cipher are significantly more complex.
